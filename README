=== ** Installation ** ===
Check your Trinity revision before install!
1) Apply NPCBots.patch with Git patch command (patch -p1 < NPCBots.patch)
2) (re)Run CMake
3) Compile
4) Apply .sql files from sql/Bots/ to proper databases
5) Merge your config file with worldserver.conf.dist (I hope you do it manually)

=== ** Usage ** ===
* .npcbot (.npcb) - get list of possible subcommands. They are:
** add <botclass> - creates random bot of given class to selected player. Use on self
** remove (rem) - removes selected npcbot. NOTE: If you select self it will remove ALL npcbots
** command (c) ...
*** follow (fol, f) - puts all your bots to follow you (out of combat)
*** stay (st, s) - makes all your bots hold position (out of combat)
** reset (res) - recreates selected npcbot (or all of them if selected self)
** distance (dist, d) - sets bot follow distance. If used by party leader in instance will affect whole group. This parameter defines attack range and distance bots keep while following.
*** Formulas:
*** Attack distance = 0.72 * follow distance (which you set with this command);
*** Distance bots keep while following (visual) = follow distance + ((follow distance - 10) * 4);  (min: 0, max: 35)
** info (in) - shows npcbots info (amount owned, classes, alive amount etc.). If used on yourself it will show each bot party member's info (including you)
* Debug Text Emote commands:
** /bonk - lists selected npcbot's stats
** /salute - lists your stats
Also:
** To add/remove npcbot you can use gossip-like menu (.npcbot helper). You can also create a macros.
