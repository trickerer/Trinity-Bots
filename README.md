## Introduction
NPCBots is a [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/) 3.3.5/[AzerothCore](https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/) wotlk mod  

This manual is created to officially state the purpose and explain the usage of NPCBot system


---------------------------------------
## NPCBOTS
NPCBots player manual is [available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fByzoyl3rCY), by **QT Blue-AI**

NPCBots are hireable pet-like minions (with some exceptions). You don't have full control over them, but you can tune their behavior in many ways. Bots will follow you around, buff you, defend you and help you in general. Their main purpose is to support players during their leveling although they can do dungeons and raids, but expect them being stupid in there

Features of the NPCBots:  

- Fighting (via spells, melee, ranged combat)  

- Buffing  

- Healing  

- Resurrecting  

- Acting as a guard (when bot has no owner)  

- Grouping  

- DungeonFinder (they can enter dungeons with you)  

- Raids (they can participate in raids)  

- PvP (they can fight members of your opposing faction)  

- Providing you with consumables (mage, warlock)  

- Receiving buffs and consumables from you  

- Equipping gear  

- Assigning roles  

- Abilities management  

- etc...  


### NPCBot Mod Installation
#### TrinityCore
- **Pre-patched repository is [here](https://github.com/trickerer/TrinityCore-3.3.5-with-NPCBots/)**. At the very beginning of this document you can find a link to its revision at a point where it was patched with the latest version of NPCBots. Clone it using
  - `git clone https://github.com/trickerer/TrinityCore-3.3.5-with-NPCBots.git --depth 1`
- If you still prefer to patch the core yourself, clone both TrinityCore and Trinity-Bots using
  - `git clone https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore.git -b 3.3.5 --depth 1`
  - `git clone https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots.git`
- Installing NPCBots is not much different from clean install so regardless of the chosen installation method follow [TrinityCore Installation Guide](https://TrinityCore.info/) to install the server to the point before it asks you to run it
- Now if you used a pre-patched repo jump to step `5`, otherwise keep on reading

1. Copy `Trinity-Bots/NPCBots.patch` file to your `TrinityCore` folder
2. Apply the patch using `patch -p1 < NPCBots.patch` command (`git apply NPCBots.path` may not work)
3. Re-run CMake and re-build
4. Merge worldserver.conf.dist into your worldserver.conf file (copy NPCBot mod settings)
5. Apply NPCBot SQL files from `/TrinityCore/sql/Bots/` to your DB (`auth_`, `characters_` and `world_` go to `auth`, `characters` and `world` DB respectively) using whichever way you prefer:
  - using `merge_sqls_...` shell scripts and **_only_** applying created `ALL_auth.sql`, `ALL_characters.sql` and `ALL_world.sql` files OR
  - manually applying each SQL file in their name order:
    - 1_world_bot_appearance.sql
    - 2_world_bot_extras.sql
    - 3_world_bots.sql
    - 4_world_generate_bot_equips.sql
    - 5_world_botgiver.sql
    - characters_bots.sql
    - updates from `/TrinityCore/sql/Bots/updates/<DB>/` for each DB
6. Run the server

#### AzerothCore
- **Pre-patched repository is [here](https://github.com/trickerer/AzerothCore-wotlk-with-NPCBots/)**. At the very beginning of this document you can find a link to its revision at a point where it was patched with the latest version of NPCBots. Clone it using
  - `git clone https://github.com/trickerer/AzerothCore-wotlk-with-NPCBots.git --depth 1`
- If you still prefer to patch the core yourself, clone both AzerothCore and Trinity-Bots using
  - `git clone https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk.git --depth 1`
  - `git clone https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots.git`
- Installing NPCBots is not much different from clean install so regardless of the chosen installation method follow [AzerothCore Installation Guide](https://azerothcore.org/wiki/installation) to install the server to the point before it asks you to run it
- Now if you used a pre-patched repo jump to step `5`, otherwise keep on reading

1. Copy `Trinity-Bots/AC/NPCBots.patch` file to your `azerothcore-wotlk` folder
2. Apply the patch using `patch -p1 < NPCBots.patch` command (`git apply NPCBots.path` may not work)
3. Re-run CMake and re-build
4. Merge worldserver.conf.dist into your worldserver.conf file (copy NPCBot mod settings)
5. **Only if `Updates.AutoSetup` is set to 0 in config or if your base DBs are already created**. Apply NPCBot base DB SQL files from `azerothcore-wotlk/data/sql/base/` to appropriate DBs:
  - db_characters/characters_npcbot.sql
  - db_characters/characters_npcbot_group_member.sql
  - db_characters/characters_npcbot_stats.sql
  - db_characters/characters_npcbot_transmog.sql
  - db_world/creature_template_npcbot_appearance.sql
  - db_world/creature_template_npcbot_extras.sql
  - db_world/creature_template_outfits.sql
6. **Only if `Updates.EnableDatabases` is set to 0 in config**. Apply NPCBot SQL updates from `/azerothcore-wotlk/data/sql/custom/` to your DB (`db_auth/`, `db_characters/` and `db_world/` SQL files go to `auth`, `characters` and `world` DB respectively) one by one
7. Run the server

### NPCBot Commands
First of all, to list your NPCBot's stats, use `/bonk` on them (Warning: big list)  

Note that some commands may not be available to all accounts (depending on their access level and permissions set in the RBAC tables (TC) / in the `command` table (AC)). You may need to change your account permissions / security level to enable usage of some commands
Most NPCBot commands are divised by persmissions into two groups: player commands and GM commands, there are also some Admin-only commands
```
KEY:
< >  (angled brackets) indicates essential command argument  
[ ]  (square brackets) indicates optional command argument  
 |  (pipe character) indicates argument choices (i.e. this|that  = this OR that)  
_ARGUMENT_  indicates argument names  
```
**COMMAND**: **`.npcbot`**, **`.npcb`** -- (Player command) by itself will list all syntax available  

- **`lookup <_CLASS_> [_UNSPAWNED_ONLY_]`** -- (GM command) lookup the NPCBot entries by <CLASS>, returns list of NPCBots as ID, Name and Race  
    - _CLASS_ = class ID (i.e. 1 for WARRIOR). **`.npcbot lookup` (`.npcb loo`)** (without the argument) to list class IDs  
    - _UNSPAWNED_ONLY_ = boolean flag, if set to 1 shows only NPCBots which weren't spawned yet  
    **Example Usage**:  
        - `.npcbot lookup 7` (to list all Shamans)  
        - `.npcb loo 11 1` (to list all unspawned Druids)  
- **`list`** -- (GM command)  
    - **`spawned`** -- Lists all spawned bots in the world, their location and quick status  
        - **`free`** -- Same as above but only lists **unowned** bots  
            **Example Usage**:  
                - `.npcbot list spawned`  
                - `.npcbot list spawned free`  
                - `.npcbot list s f`  
- **`add _TARGET_`** -- (GM command) selected NPCBot becomes yours bypassing the price condition. Only works on NPCBots which have no owner  
    - _TARGET_ = selected NPCBot  
    **Example Usage**:  
        - `.npcbot add`  
        - `.npcb add`  
- **`remove _TARGET_`** -- (GM command) dismisses the NPCBot(s) from player's control. **Any bot removed via this command retains its gear**  
    - _TARGET_ = selected active NPCBot (dismisses selected NPCBot)

        - `.npcbot remove`  
        - `.npcb rem`

        - `.npcbot free`  
- **`spawn <_ENTRY_|_LINK_>`** -- (GM command) spawns a NPCBot in world, NPCBot is saved in DB. Only works in world maps (not instances). Note that unlike other creatures only one instance of each NPCBot can be spawned, but don't worry: there are many NPCBots to choose from  
    - _ENTRY_ = ID of NPCBot (can be obtained from lookup list)  
    - _LINK_ = creature_template link added by Shift-click (obtained from lookup list)

    - _SOUNDSET_ = NPC voice variant for bot to use. There are 3 variants for each race, by default the choice is random  
    **Example Usage:**  
        - `.npcbot createnew Selendris 8 10 1 6 4 3 2 4` (creates a female redhead Blood Elf mage npcbot)  
        - `.npcb cre Selendris 8 10 1 6 4 3 2 4` (creates a female redhead Blood Elf mage npcbot)  
        - `.npcb createnew ranges` (prints visuals constraints for all races)  

### NPCBot Control and Usage
#### NPCBot Getting started
If this is your first time using an NPCBot, you'll need to do the following to get started:

- `.npcbot lookup`  

This will give you a listing of the available classes with an ID to indicate each class. For example, 1 is the class ID for Warriors.  

_Example Output_:
```
.npcbot lookup #class
Looks up npcbots by #class, and return all matches with their creature ID's.
BOT_CLASS_WARRIOR = 1
BOT_CLASS_PALADIN = 2
BOT_CLASS_HUNTER = 3
BOT_CLASS_ROGUE = 4
BOT_CLASS_PRIEST = 5
BOT_CLASS_DEATH_KNIGHT = 6
BOT_CLASS_SHAMAN = 7
BOT_CLASS_MAGE = 8
BOT_CLASS_WARLOCK = 9
BOT_CLASS_DRUID = 11
BOT_CLASS_BLADEMASTER = 12
BOT_CLASS_SPHYNX = 13
BOT_CLASS_ARCHMAGE = 14
BOT_CLASS_DREADLORD = 15
BOT_CLASS_SPELLBREAKER = 16
BOT_CLASS_DARK_RANGER = 17
BOT_CLASS_NECROMANCER = 18
BOT_CLASS_SEA_WITCH = 19
BOT_CLASS_CRYPT_LORD = 20
```

After you have figured out which class you want to lookup type in:

- `.npcbot lookup 1`
```
Looking for bots of class 1...
70001 - [Llane] Human
70002 - [Thran] Dwarf
70003 - [Lyria] Human
70004 - [Ander] Dwarf
70005 - [Malosh] Orc
70006 - [Granis] Dwarf
...
70038 - [Kerra] Blood Elf
```
Next, you'll select an NPCBot from the list:

- `.npcbot spawn 70003`  
For this example, we'll select Lyria with an ID of 70003

Lyria will spawn at your location as a level 80 Warrior (by default, NPCBots spawn at max level)  
Note that NPCBot you spawned is friendly. By default NPCBots spawn with faction ID set to 35 (friendly to all) But NPCBots will follow realm PvP rules, even if it's a FFAPvP  
Also, NPCBots do not attack anything unless provoked, at which point they may attempt to do whatever it takes to kill their target; they can be very persistent  
**NPCBots can only be spawned in world maps**

Right-clicking on the NPCBot will open a _Gossip Menu_ (which gives you some command choices)  
_Example Output_:
```
You need something?
- <Hire bot>
- Nevermind
```
Note: if you are have a GM mode enabled you will also see a '\<Debug\>' menu

Next, you'll most likely just select '\<Hire bot\>' which will popup a confirmation box asking:   
"Do you wish to hire Lyria?", with a cost amount that you can _Accept_ or _Cancel_.
Note: price scales with your level, but rare and elite bots cost more and may require you to be at least level X to hire them

After NPCBot is hired, they will automatically match your level.  
Right-clicking on the NPCBot will open a new Gossip Menu with an assortment of options (described in following subsections). Your NPCBot will follow you around in or out of group, but it's probably a good idea to get them into your group so you can monitor their location on mini-map, or health/mana, etc. Your new hired Gossip Menu will show:
```
- Manage equipment...
- Manage roles...
- Manage formation...
- Manage abilities...
- Manage talents...
- Give consumable...
- <Create Group>
- You are dismissed
- Pull yourself together, damnit
- Nevermind
- [OPTIONAL options may be displayed here]
- <Create Group (all bots)>
- <Add to group>
- <Add all bots to group>
- <Remove from group>
- [CLASS-SPECIFIC options may be displayed here]
```

For now, select '\<Create Group\>' and your NPCBot will join your group and you can begin your adventures!  
As mentioned previously, the other options will be discussed further down this document.

#### NPCBot Hiring Alternatives
If you want you can also spawn an NPC which provides NPCBots hiring services. This is done normal way through `.npc add` command:

- `.npc add 70000`  
Right-click on the NPC will open a _Gossip Menu_:  
```
There are always dudes ready to kill for money.
- I need your services
- Nevermind
```

Down the menu you will find a list of classes of NPCBots. After you select one, a list of NPCBots in the world available to you will appear.  
Note that conditions you need to meet to hire NPCBots this way are completely the same as you would normally have, the only difference is that you don't need to go around the world to find NPCBots you need.

#### NPCBot Getting Around
Whether grouped or not, your NPCBot will follow you around, keeping you buffed along the way (if they can buff), healing you when needed (if it is a healer-type NPCBot), attacking things alongside you and even ressurecting you if you die (if they can ressurect, that is). NPCBots are designed to keep up to your run pace and will mount up on their own version of your mount when you do. In the event that they cannot keep up (due to you moving too fast or they being stuck in combat or something), your NPCBot will eventually teleport to your location (even if you go into another map).  
NOTE: NPCBots cannot teleport to you when you are in a dungeon, if they are not part of your group.

For the most part, go somewhere and they will follow. Simple as that.
In those cases where following might not be safe or you want to proceed safely, you have a few options.

If your NPCBot is in your direct vicinity, you can target them and emote:
- `/stand` to make your NPCBot stay put
- `/wave` to make your NPCBot follow you again

If your NPCBot is not targetable or in the immediate vicinity (for selection), you can use the commands:

- `.npcbot command stay` (`.npcb c s`) to make all your controlled NPCBots STAY

- `.npcbot command follow` (`.npcb c f`) to make all your controlled NPCBots FOLLOW

In the event your NPCBot is too far away to path to you, your NPCBot will teleport themself to you.
You can also use `.npcbot recall teleport` command to force your NPCBots to teleport to you

When you leave the world your NPCBots aren't hanging around outside the dungeon you decided to log out at. Unless you spawned that NPCBot outside that dungeon. When you log out your NPCBots temporarily become normal free NPCBots (but not hireable because they already have an owner - you) and return to their spawn location. If you picked up your NPCBot in Darnassus, it will return there. If you spawned your NPCBot on the road through the Barrens, it will return there. This can be both annoying and good, spawning NPCBots in a good central location (like in cities), will provide you an easy way to hire them (and coincidentally, they like to hang out and buff passerbys).

#### NPCBot Equipment
NPCBots spawn with some basic equipment and clothes. Some NPCBots however start with some rather powerful weapons but they are only visual and provide no benefits: no damage, no stats. Nothing. They are __purely visual__. In fact, in most cases these weapons are partial to class appearance and will always stay (like Dark Ranger and her trusty bow)  
NPCBots give you the ability to customize their individual gear pieces to make them more effective in combat. Note that visual changes to NPCBot's equipment are not instant (except weapons)

To make changes to their gear, you need to right-click that NPCBot and choose `Manage equipment...` from their post-hire Gossip Menu. You should then see the following:
```
- Show me your inventory
- Auto-equip...
- Main hand...
- Ranged...
- Head...
- Shoulders...
- Chest...
- Waist...
- Legs...
- Feet...
- Wrist...
- Hands...
- Back...
- Shirt...
- Finger 1...
- Finger 2...
- Trinket 1...
- Trinket 2...
- Neck...
- Unequip all
- Update visual
- BACK
```
As you can see, you can gear up pretty much every slot on your NPCBot

- `Show me your inventory` will make the NPCBot whisper you a list of everything they currently have including an item icon (helps to understand which slot the item is equipped into)

- `Auto-equip` will list out all the items you have in YOUR bags that the NPCBot can use. Clicking on one of those items will automatically give it to the NPCBot and equip it into the appropriate slot

- `_(INDIVIDUAL GEAR SLOTS)_` will show you what they have equipped (if any), an option to use their old equipment (if any to start with) OR an unequip option (if you gave them some gear), a listing of any item in YOUR bags that the NPCBot can use in that slot and a BACK option. Selecting any of your bag items will automatically send that item to the NPCBot and have them equip it. The option to use old equipment or unequip gear will have the NPCBot RETURN the gear you gave them BACK to YOUR bags. They will then return to the default gear/state for that slot. You can also transmogrify items in displayed gear slots (if this feature is enabled) using items you have in your inventory/bags, refer to worldserver config for transmog rules

- `Unequip all` will have them do just that... dump __ALL__ gear you have given them back into YOUR bags. If you don't have enough space in your bags the excess items will be mailed to you.  NOTE: When firing an NPCBot, any gear you have given your NPCBot will automatically be returned to you

- There is an additional optional item in this menu called `Bot gear bank...` which can be enabled by setting `NpcBot.GearBank.Enable = 1` in config. It gives access to unlimited storage for gear - useful when you have too many bots to keep all their extra gear in your own bags. This is an exploit of course so this feature is disabled by default. Note that this storage is saved per player so you will not lose this gear when your last bot is dismissed, but at the same time you won't be able to access it without bots to talk to

- `BACK` just goes back to the previous menu

#### NPCBot Roles
NPCBot Role management allows you to adjust how they operate overall. The available options are dependent upon the class of the NPCBot you are controlling

To adjust the NPCBot's roles, you need to right-click that NPCBot and choose `Manage roles...` from their Gossip Menu. You should then see (dependent upon the class):
```
- Gathering...
- Looting...
- Tank
- Off-Tank
- DPS
- Heal
- Ranged
- BACK
```
Clicking on the respective Role will toggle it on/off (changing the icon)

The roles can be a little tricky to understand:

- "Tanking" role means that NPCBots will try to produce as much threat as possible, use taunt-like abilities to reaggro targets attacking friends and use defensive cooldowns more liberally. This does NOT include attacking anything. "Tanking" bots with no "Off-Tanking" enabled are considered Main Tanks and will always stay on targets pointed by `TankTargetIconMask` (see [Config Settings](#npcbot-config-settings))

- "Off-Tanking" is an addition to "Tanking" role and makes tanking NPCBots prioritize targets pointed by `OffTankTargetIconMask`. Enabling this role will automatically enable "Tanking" role also

- "DPS" role allows NPCBots to actually deal damage. If this role is disabled NPCBot will not use damaging abilities, not even auto-attack

- "Heal" is what your healers need to have enabled. If this role is disabled NPCBots will not even try to heal anything, not even themselves. No, not even in a face of certain death

- "Ranged" role affects NPCBots' positioning and the distance they will keep from their attack target. Ranged DPS non-tanking bots will always attack target pointed by `RangedDPSTargetIconMask`
_Example_: Warrior having Tanking + DPS + Ranged role enabled will constantly try to taunt the target and run away, only attacking if target catches up

It's recommended to only enable 1 or 2 specific roles for that class to minimize them switching tactics around alot. The only exception is Priest which can handle DPS, Heal and Ranged roles just fine (they will preserve some mana for healing and resort to wand)

`Gathering...` roles allow NPCBots to collect different ores, herbs, leather and other trade goods. It does NOT allow to track those goods so good luck with that. It also does NOT allow bots to craft anything. NPCBots have their skill assigned according to their level so level 1 NPCBot for example will not be able to mine Mithril. Note that bots will only use nodes **you** are very close to

`Looting...` roles allow NPCBots to automatically and quickly collect items from nearby lootable creatures for you and other players in your group. Make sure to chose loot method, quality threshold in your group and looting setting for your looter bot

#### NPCBot Formation
Some times you just want your NPCBot close.. or as far away as possible. The formation option allows you to adjust your NPCBot's distance from you.

Select `Manage formation...` from their Gossip Menu to adjust the formation. You will see:
```
- Follow distance (current: XX)
- DISABLE combat positioning
- Attack distance...
- Attack angle...
- Engage behavior...
- Priority target (Tank)...
- Priority target (DPS)...
- BACK
```
NOTE1: you will see `DISABLE combat positioning`, `Attack distance...` and `Attack angle...` only if NPCBot has `Ranged` role assigned  
NOTE2: you will see `Engage behavior` only if NPCBot is not a tank  
NOTE3: you will see `Priority target (<Role>)...` only if NPCBot has required role(s), you are in group, and at least one target icon belonging to respectful target icon mask is set (see [Config Settings](#npcbot-config-settings)). **Priority targets are set for each NPCBot individually**  
Selecting `Follow distance` will open up a popup window that you can enter in an amount. This amount can be anywhere from **0** to **100**. Setting any higher than **100** will default to **100** and any lower than **0** to **0**. Setting the distance to **0** will result in the NPCBot PASSIVELY following you rather closely and not engaging mobs unless you attack

If `DISABLE combat positioning` option is checked your `Ranged` NPCBots will not try to assume attack positions and will instead retain their follow positioning even in combat, only attacking targets in reach

Selecting `Attack distance...` will allow you to set ranged attack distance. You will see:
```
- Short range attacks
- Long range attacks
- Exact (0-50)
- BACK
```
NOTE: if "Exact" mode is set, its text will change to
```
- Exact (current: XX)
```
Short range are attacks that are the shortest distance of all ranged attacks for NPCBot's class. For example for paladins it is 10 yards (Judgement range) and for Mages it is 20 yards (Fire Blast range)  
Long range attacks are the opposite of short range ones. For most classes this range is about 30-35 yards. This mode is useful when attacking something too dangerous to stand close to  
Selecting `Exact` will open up a popup window that you can enter in an amount. This amount can be anywhere from **0** to **50**. Same rules as for follow distance  
NOTE: setting exact attack distance to **0** will make NPCBots (and their pets) trying to position themselves on top of their target (ignoring model size)

`Attack angle...` allows you to set ranged bots positioning mode. You will see:
```
- Normal
- Avoid frontal AOE
- BACK
```
If you tell your NPCBots to avoid frontal AOE they will try to position themselves in the way that they won't get hit, behing their target and to the either side, but only if you do the same or are already in melee range of the target

`Engage behavior...` submenu is used to manage bots' behaviour when combat is initiated:
```
- Delay attack by: X.XXs
- Heal target health threshold: XX%
- BACK
```
Attack delay is time (in seconds) your `DPS` NPCBots will wait before they start attacking. **This does not apply to Tanks and Healers**  
Heal threshold is a unit health percentage, friendly units at which or below will be considered a viable heal target for your NPCBot. This is a way to tell your DPS+Heal bots to not heal anyone unless it's *really* needed. This parameter is individual to each bot. **Only available to Healers**

`Priority target (<Role>)...` allows you to set main target for each bot individually and by role:
```
- <Icon> <Name>
- <Icon> <Name>
- ...
- <None>
- BACK
```
Here `Icon` is group target icon (skull, cross, etc.), `Name` is marked unit's name. Number of those rows is the number of **active** icons belonging to corresponding role. If marked target is attackable then at engage instead of normal targeting this NPCBot will immediately rush towards this unit. Be aware that priority target is **set by icon** and will persist when icon is set to another unit, this new unit becomes new priority target to all bots who have priority set to this icon. Selecting `None` disables priority target for this NPCBot.

#### NPCBot Abilities
NPCBots use most of real class spells. Some spells/abilities such as buffs, heals, remove curse/poison, etc. are available through an NPCBot's Abilities menu. Level restrictions apply to NPCBots too, for example Warlock will not be able to use Fear until level 8  
Selecting `Manage abilities...` from the Gossip menu will give you a listing of spells/abilities that they can cast on you or for you. The "Update" option will refresh the spell listing as some spell may be cooled at the moment  
If spell is not listed this doesn't mean NPCBot does not have the spell, probably you just cannot use it manually  
NPCBots' abilities check algorithm includes finding missing buffs, friends to heal, restocking on consumables (like healthstones), class enchants (Rogue, Shaman), utilities (like using Sprint if falling far behind), spells for party and self, self-heals, finding crowd control targets and finally, attack abilities

Using `Manage allowed abilities...` submenu you can make bots not use some of their spells. Disabled spells list is saved in DB

#### NPCBot Talents
NPCBots don't use normal talent pick choice system. Instead, main talent tree is used (according to a spec) while also picking vital talents from other two trees up to tier 3 (available to players of the same spec).  
Select `Manage talents...` from the Gossip menu to chose a spec. Bot will activate it and continue to progress with chosen spec as you level up. This action has no cooldown

#### NPCBot Grouping
Although NPCBots will follow their owner around grouped or ungrouped and will usually buff people outside their groups, creating group will make NPCBots properly utilize buffs reserved for group members only  
Grouping is also required to properly utilize the DungeonFinder (as you cannot summon NPCBots in or into instances that are ungrouped)

>**NOTE**:
>If DungeonFinder group has only one real player loot rules will be set to _Free For All_

#### NPCBots and Vehicles
NPCBots will always try to use vehicles when player does. With random vehicle types bots will simply copy player actions, but for the essential vehicles bots will use their own tactics. Here is the list:
```
Wyrmrest Skytalon (Eye of Eternity)
Ruby Drake (Oculus)
Emerald Drake (Oculus)
Amber Drake (Oculus)
Argent Warhorse / Battleworg (Trial of the Champion)
Alliance / Horde Gunship Cannon (Icecrown Citadel Gunship Battle)
Mutated Abomination (Icecrown Citadel Professor Putricide, bots will never use)
```
Note: NPCBots do not dismount from vehicles automatically while in combat. Use `.npcbot vehicle eject` command to force them out of their vehicles.

#### NPCBot Extras
Depending on NPCBot's class, there may be extra options found in the Gossip menu for that NPCBot

For example, Rogue NPCBots will present the options:
```
- Help me pick a lock (XX)
- I need you to refresh poisons
- <Choose poison (Main Hand)>
- <Choose poison (Offhand)>
```
Lockpicks allow you to open locked chests in the world and locked items in your inventory. The skill level (XX) is based on NPCBot's level  
Poisons can be chosen for the expected encounters. You'll have to tell your NPCBot to refresh the poisons when you are done

Shaman NPCBots have similar menu for their weapon enchants

Mage NPCBots will give you:
```
- I need food
- I need drink
- I need a refreshment table
- I need a portal
```
These options will summon a stack of food or drink for you  
If your level is high enough, the mage NPCBot can summon a refreshment table and portals for you and your group

Warlock NPCBots will present the options:
```
- I need your healthstone
- I need a soulwell
```
First option will make that Warlock give you their healthstone  
If your level is high enough, the warlock NPCBot can summon a soulwell  
Level restrictions are applied here, too

Hunter and Warlock NPCBots (once they reach level 10) also have pet submenu:
```
- <Choose pet type>
```
You are still aware of level restrictions, right?  
Because they don't quite apply to Hunter. He can summon any pet type, yet exotic pets are only unlocked at 80

Lastly, all NPCBots will have the following extra options:
```
- You are dismissed
- Nevermind
```
`You are dismissed` will remove the NPCBot from your control. They will become pissed off, throw all their gear at you and return back to their spawn location. They will also become enraged for 5 minutes to the point where they will attack anyone attempting to hire them (this can be disabled in config)  
`Nevermind` will simply close out the Gossip menu

### NPCBot Wander System
Besides their main purpose which is to assist players, NPCBots can also be used as autonomous units. Wandering bots spawn with gear, but are free of player's control and cannot be hired. Here is a list of features supported:  
1. Wandering bots in open world. Config setting **`NpcBot.WanderingBots.Continents.Count`** controls desired amount of bots roaming world maps. Spawn points are random and level is selected accordingly. These bots give small reward for kill and bonus experience. See the config file for more info.  
2. Wandering bots generated for Battlegrounds. Enabled by **`NpcBot.WanderingBots.BG.Enable`** setting, this feature allows to generate NPCBots to fill BG queue and partake in BG matches.  

### NPCBot Config Settings
If some config settings look ambiguous this section may be of help to you

- **`NpcBot.BaseFollowDistance`**
    - This parameter determines formation size and enemy chase cutoff distance
    - Value range: **0-100**
    - Not saved between log-ins  
    Explanation. Bots group around you in a formation where tanks are in front, melee are on the sides and ranged are in the back. The distance they keep from you is not changed if value of this parameter is 30 or less. Past 30 it is increased linearly up to additional 10 yards between you and a your bots. The distance at which bots start attacking incoming enemies is determined by this parameter as well. This is distance between *player* (or *bot*, if stationed) and the enemy and is about 75% of this paramenter's value. If bot's attack target moves outside of this range bot stops attacking it (unless you attack this target as well) and retreats. **This means** that if this parameter is set low bot actions and chase movement may become erratic. If this parameter is set to **0** bots will act passively unless you point an attack targets (with your melee attack, only works in combat); this may be useful in case you want bots to attack and retreat, or in situation where blind attack is dangerous and you need bots to attack only targets you want them to. **Auto-attack spells like Autoshot or Shoot Wand cancel your melee attack**
- **`NpcBot.XpReduction`**
    - This parameter allows you to set XP gain percent penalty for players using bots during leveling. When there is more than one player in a group the maximum number of bots hired by any player in group is used for XP reduction amount calculation
    - Value range: **0-90**  
    Explanation. XP amount is reduced by a percentage for every used bot after first one (it doesn't matter if bots are in group with player or not). Two bots are able to do much more damage than one player, especially at low levels. Bots also open great potential for grind. So you may want to punish your players a little. The formula is: **(100 - X \* (Y - 1))%** XP gained, where **X** is XP reduction and **Y** is bots count. *Example: XP reduction is 10, bots count = 4; XP gained: 100 - 10 * (4 - 1) = 70% XP gained*. In any case, overall XP reduction from this parameter will never exceed 90%. **This penalty only applies to bots' owner**
- **`NpcBot.HealTargetIconsMask`**
    - This parameter allows players to mark units not under player's control as friends using Target Icons  
    Explanation. Sometimes you need to protect targets other than yourself, escort quests are a good example. With this parameter activated players can set *Raid Icon* on a target they want bots to care about. Bots will treat said target as a member of player's party, heal it if needed and assist it in combat. Parameter itself is a bit mask and consists of a combination of values assigned to each target icon: **Star - 1, Circle - 2, Diamond - 4, Triangle - 8, Moon - 16, Square - 32, Cross - 64, Skull - 128**. *Example: Star, Diamond and Triangle = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13*
- **`NpcBot.TankTargetIconsMask`**
    - This parameter is similar to `NpcBot.HealTargetIconsMask`, but this one marks targets for your NPCBot main tanks
    - Your main tanks **will not stop attacking pointed target** until it's dead or icon is unset
- **`NpcBot.OffTankTargetIconsMask`**
    - This parameter is similar to `NpcBot.TankTargetIconsMask`**, but this one marks targets for your NPCBot off-tanks
    - Your off-tanks **will not stop attacking pointed target** until it's dead or icon is unset
- **`NpcBot.DPSTargetIconsMask`**
    - Same as `NpcBot.TankTargetIconsMask`, but this one affects your damage dealers, and (off-)tanks with DPS role enabled without pointed tanking target, with the same rules
- **`NpcBot.RangedDPSTargetIconsMask`**
    - Same as `NpcBot.DPSTargetIconsMask` but this one only affects your ranged NPCBots
- **`NpcBot.NoDPSTargetIconMask`**
    - NPCBots will try to not damage these targets
- **`Heal / Tank / DPS _TargetIconsMask` priorities**
    - For every pointed target type priority goes in reverse order of target icons list in right-click dropdown menu: from *Skull* (highest) to *Star* (lowest)
- **`Heal / Tank / DPS _TargetIconsMask` intersections**
    - If there are any bitmask intersections between target icons (simply put, same icon is used, on accident or otherwise), these rules are applied:
        - Heal + DPS target **will not be protected** by taunting or attacking the attackers
        - Heal + DPS target **may still be healed** if can be healed
        - Heal + DPS target **may still be attacked** if attackable and in combat
        - Heal + (Off-)Tank target **will still be tanked** if can be attacked
        - All DPS icons will be automatically excluded from **`NoDPSTargetIconMask`**
- **`NpcBot.Cost`**
    - This parameter determines how much money player has to pay to hire a bot
    - This is how much money player has to pay **at level 80**, for lower levels cost is reduced:
        - level  1-10: cost / 5000
        - level 11-20: cost / 100
        - level 21-30: cost / 20
        - level 31-40: cost / 5
        - level  41+:  cost / 80 \* level  
    Explanation. The value you set is in copper (1 silver = 100 copper, 1 gold = 100 silver = 10000 copper). Rare and Elite bots cost more (**x2** for Rare and **x5** for Elite)
- **`NpcBot.Movements.InterruptFood`**
    - This parameter determines if bots should stop eating and drinking if they move  
    Explanation. By default this parameter is disabled to prevent bots' food and drinks spam since bots try to eat and drink whenever they have the chance, which is every time they don't do anything even for a fraction of a second
- **`NpcBot.EquipmentDisplay.Enable`**
    - This parameter allows bots to display equipped items other than weapons on their model  
    Explanation. Normally, for creatures game client only draws default model determined by model ID. This parameter force feeds clients information about unit model and items in equipment slots which is generated at server side; so instead of default model client draws player model components including skin color, face, facial hair and others including "equipped" items. The only problem players may encounter comes from a game client bug which can cause a crash at game exit (client crash, not server crash) with error \#132. This bug can be reproduced by changing base model of unit having UNIT_FLAG2_MIRROR_IMAGE more than 4 times in a short period of time, so bots being polymorphed or druids shapeshifting have higher chance of causing this problem

### NPCBot Mod Localization
All localizable string are contained in `npc_text` table. If you want to make a translation you'll have to populate `npc_text_locale` table accordingly (`Text0_0` field)  

### NPCBot Extra Classes
#### General Information
NPCBot mod features several custom classes inspired by Warcraft III. These bots are ranked Rare, Elite or Rareelite, have different mana increase rate and cannot drink to restore mana, have increased level and hire cost, may have minimum player level requirement. Also, control magic affects them much less, even less than is does players. They are not intended to be as effective as normal classes and/or balanced at any given level. Their main purpose is to support you and other bots. For basic information on certain class use Gossip Menu and click `<Study the creature>`. If you need more info keep on reading  

#### Blademaster
*(Disabled in last version)*  
**Rank: Rare**  
**Level Bonus: +1**  
**Minimum player level: 1**  
**Equipment affects visual: no**  
**Number included: 1**  
**Class specifics:** Very high attack speed, equipped weapon does not affect attack speed, attack power from stats: agility x9, cannot crit with normal attacks, cannot dodge or parry, bonus armor penetration 80%  
Equippable weapon: 2h swords, 2h axes and polearms

Abilities:

- Netherwalk. Blademaster becomes invisible and moves faster for 30 seconds. If Blademaster breaks invisibility to attack, he will deal 150% damage on first attack
- Mirror Image. Blademaster disappears, creating 1-3 illusions of himself (depends on hero's level). Also dispells all magic from him. Mirror Images deal no real damage and take 200% damage themselves
- Critical Strike (passive). Gives 15% chance to deal critical strike for x2-x4 times normal damage (depends on hero's level)
- Bladestorm (not implemented)  

**Additional info:** Blademaster stands out as a class with highest single target damage capabilities and ability to almost one-shot most things if geared properly. Unfortunately, due to changes in movement mechanic, Blademaster's critical strike animation can no longer be emulated, and thus this class was disabled in last version  

#### Obsidian Destroyer
**Rank: Rareelite**  
**Level Bonus: +3**  
**Minimum player level: 60**  
**Equipment affects visual: weapons only**  
**Number included: 2**

- Shadow Blast. Empowered attack that deals increased splash damage to targets in a rather large area. Main target takes more damage than others
- Drain Mana. Drains all mana from a random ***friendly*** unit. The amount drained is limited by Obsidian Destroyer's maximum mana. **This ability cannot be disabled**

- Replenish Health. Heals all surrounding party and raid members within 25 yards for 3% of their maximum health. *This ability drains all mana*
- Shadow Armor (passive). Restores mana equal to a percentage of damage taken. This ability only triggers when damage taken is enough to restore 10% of Obsidian Destroyer's mana  

**Additional info:** Obsidian Destroyer in fact derives from a non-hero unit, but received elite status because of the ability to deal insane amounts of damage given the chance, support party of any kind, dispel, purge AND tank at the same time, utilizing abilities of original unit's both forms: statue form and true form  

#### Archmage
**Rank: Rare**  
**Level Bonus: +1**  
**Minimum player level: 20**

Equippable weapon: staves

- Summon Water Elemental. Archmage Water Elemental has 1 minute duration and 20 sec cooldown, cannot run out of mana and deals more damage since W3 Archmage could have 3 active Elementals
- Brilliance Aura. Increases maximum mana by 10% and mana regeneration by 100% of party and raid members within 40 yards
- Mass Teleport (not implemented)  

**Additional info:** Archmage is most valued for his support capabilities in large groups, although he is very squishy  

#### Dreadlord
**Rank: Rareelite**  
**Level Bonus: +3**  
**Minimum player level: 60**  
**Equipment affects visual: no**

- Infernal. Summons an Infernal Servant at dest location, damaging and stunning enemy units in the area. Infernal is very resistant to magic and its stats scale with Dreadlord's stats. Infernal burns, dealing damage to surrounding enemies every 2 seconds, 180 sec duration  

**Additional info:** Dreadlord is most useful in a big party with a lot of melee classes and also can be very annoying in pvp if packed with enough haste and armor penetration  

#### Spell Breaker

**Minimum player level: 20**  
**Equipment affects visual: no**  
**Number included: 5**

- Feedback (passive). Melee attacks burn target's mana dealing arcane damage. Amount burned is equal to melee damage dealt increased by spell power.

If target does't have mana then instead of draining Spellbreaker's damage restores his own mana equal to 25% of damage dealt
- Control Magic (not implemented)  

**Additional info:** Spell Breaker is mostly pure support class incapable of dealing any serious damage, but may also make quick work of some hapless caster, burning all his mana in seconds

**Additional info:** Dark Ranger has most use in solo combined with healer, or as a support in big group due to Silence low cooldown and no other mana sinks  

#### Necromancer
**Rank: Elite**  
**Level Bonus: +2**  
**Minimum player level: 20**  
**Equipment affects visual: no**  
**Number included: 5**

**Additional info:** Necromancer has some Diablo II spirit to it. Curses may come in the future. Necromancer is mainly a support class, he doesn't have any damaging abilities besides CE, but Skeletons combined with Unholy Frenzy can help quite a lot

- Locust Swarm. Crypt Lord releases a swarm of 20-40 (depends on Crypt Lord's level) angry locusts that bite and tear at nearby enemy units, reducing their ability to move or attack. As they chew the enemy flesh, they convert it into a substance that restores hit points to the Crypt Lord when they return. Unlocked at level 40.  

**Additional info:** Crypt Lord is a great melee damage dealer and with little support he becomes a not bad melee tank. Higher levels also provide moderate CC capabilities. Crypt Lord is immune to poison-based effect (but not damage)

    Also writes to:
        - `item_instance` (item owner assignment)
- `world` DB
    - `creature_template_outfits` (created by this mod) contains static display information

    - `creature` contains info about spawned creatures in the world  
    \* \- max id may be exceeded by custom NPCBots created

If you want to make changes to the static template data used for NPCBots, you make adjustments in the `world` database to those specific ids in the above tables (i.e. npcbot model, outfits, etc.)  
**Do not** tinker with `characters` DB NPCBot tables, any bug reports containing accidently corrupted NPCBots installation will be discarded without notice  
If you need to delete custom created NPCBot you need to first delete the bot from the world (using `.npcbot delete` command; you need to remove their equipment first, otherwise the items become inaccessible). Then delete by entry (creature id) from `creature_template_npcbot_extras`, `creature_template_npcbot_appearance` and `creature_equip_template` tables, and finally, from `creature_template`  
If you need to remove NPCBot mod completely you need to first delete every spawned bot in the world (using `.npcbot delete` command). Then delete `characters_npcbot`, `characters_npcbot_group_member`, `characters_npcbot_transmog`, `characters_npcbot_gear_storage`, `creature_template_npcbot_extras`, `creature_template_npcbot_appearance` and `creature_template_npcbot_wander_nodes` tables and clean all other used tables of entries by id (70000-71000 + possibly more custom bot entries). `creature_template_outfits` can also be deleted if you are not using Npc Dress Mod

#### Game World
Bots are counted as active objects and keep map grids loaded like players
Bots are being added to world at server loading (after Map System is started)

#### Total number of bots included in fresh install: **312**
